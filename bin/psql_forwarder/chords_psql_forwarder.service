# Systemd unit description for managing the CHORDS psql_forwarder.
#
# Systemd convention locates this file in /usr/lib/systemd/system/chords_psql_forwarder.service,
# with a link to it from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/chords_psql_forwarder.service
# 
# To customize the psql_forwarder command line, edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/chords_psql_forwarder.service
#
# When you make a change to a service file:
#  systemctl daemon-reload
#
# To enable and start:
#  systemctl enable chords_psql_forwarder
#  systemctl start  chords_psql_forwarder
#
# To restart:
#  systemctl restart chords_psql_forwarder
#
# "ps -eo cmd" is a good way to see if the command is running.
#
# Here's how to see your log files:
#  since the last boot:
#    journalctl -b -u chords_psql_forwarder.service
#  To "follow" the log messages add a -f  (like tail -f):
#    journalctl -f -u chords_psql_forwarder.service
#
